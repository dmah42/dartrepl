dartrepl
========

A REPL for the dart language. Uses the same dart vm that is used to run
this app.

Works with build 17657 and some earlier. Untested with newer.

Example usage:
    `<path-to-dart-sdk>/bin/dart dartrepl.dart`
    
    >> main() => print("Hello World");
      << Hello World
    [success]
    >> // todo, enter another command...!

TODO

* Custom commands
* Color output
